# Update Memory Bank Top-Level Files

You are tasked with updating the top-level files in the Memory Bank located at `.github/memory-bank/`. 

## Instructions

1. **Identify Changes:**  
   Review the recent changes, decisions, or events that impact the overall project context, architecture, technology, or progress.

2. **Select Appropriate Files:**  
   Update only the relevant top-level files:
   - `projectBrief.md` – Project goals and scope
   - `productContext.md` – User needs and product rationale
   - `systemPatterns.md` – Architecture and design decisions
   - `techContext.md` – Stack, tooling, and constraints
   - `activeContext.md` – Current project priorities
   - `progress.md` – Overall progress and feature tracking

3. **Perform Updates:**  
   - Ensure each file reflects the latest state of the project.
   - Maintain consistency with the current documentation (e.g., `readme.md`).
   - Use clear, factual language to describe changes.

4. **Document Updates:**  
   For each file you update:
   - Clearly summarize what changed and why.
   - Add concise, factual entries.  
   - If a change is based on a feature merge, reference the feature.

5. **Maintain Clarity:**  
   Ensure all updates are precise, unambiguous, and easy to understand for a fresh reader.

6. **No Redundancy:**  
   Do not duplicate information across files. Each file has a distinct purpose.

## Output Format

For each file you update, provide:
- The filename as a header.
- A summary of the update.
