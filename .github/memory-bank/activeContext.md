# Active Context (Expanded)

The current priority is to ensure that the memory bank is always in sync with the actual structure, contributor rules, and emoji usage of the awesomelist's main documentation (e.g., readme.md). Any changes to the organization, topics, contributor guidance, or emoji legend must be reflected in the memory bank files.

- No empty sections; only add a topic/category if a resource exists.
- Each section must have an appropriate emoji.
- Each resource appears only once, in the most relevant section.
- Table of Contents and section structure must always match the main documentation.
