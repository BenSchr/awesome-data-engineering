# Product Context (Expanded)

The awesomelist exists to help users quickly discover and access high-quality data engineering resources. The structure (topic-based, generic categories, or other) should always be organized for maximum clarity and discoverability, and the memory bank must always reflect the current organization of the main documentation (e.g., readme.md).

The awesomelist is organized for maximum clarity and discoverability. Only topics/categories with at least one resource are included, and each section uses a relevant emoji for navigation. Contributor guidance and rules are documented to ensure future changes maintain this structure. The memory bank must always reflect the current organization and contributor rules as seen in the main documentation (e.g., readme.md).

- No empty sections allowed; only add a topic/category if a resource exists.
- Each section must have an appropriate emoji.
- Each resource appears only once, in the most relevant section.
- Table of Contents and section structure must always match the main documentation.
