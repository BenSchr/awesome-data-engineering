# System Patterns (Expanded)

This file documents architecture and design decisions for the project. Please describe any key patterns, conventions, or architectural choices relevant to the awesomelist.

- The awesomelist's organizational pattern (topic-based or generic categories) is flexible and must always match the current state of the main documentation (e.g., readme.md).
- Emojis are required in section headings for clarity and navigation; the emoji legend must be kept up to date.
- Contributor guidance is included to ensure future changes follow the current structure and best practices (see projectBrief.md for details).
- No empty sections: only add a topic/category if a resource exists.
- Each resource appears only once, in the most relevant section.
- The memory bank must be updated whenever the main documentation structure or contributor rules change, to avoid drift.
- Implementation follows a phased plan: audit/categorize, define structure/emojis, update content/ToC, add guidance, review/validate.
