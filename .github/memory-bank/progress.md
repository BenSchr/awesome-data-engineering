# Progress

Progress is tracked by ensuring the memory bank matches the current state of the awesomelist's main documentation (e.g., readme.md). Any changes to structure, topics, or contributor guidance must be promptly reflected in the memory bank. This ensures documentation accuracy and project continuity.

This file tracks overall progress and the status of all tracked feature branches. Please list active features, their status, and any relevant notes on project progress.
