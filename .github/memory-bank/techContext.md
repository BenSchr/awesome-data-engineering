# Tech Context

This file outlines the technology stack, tooling, and any technical constraints for the awesomelist project.

- The awesomelist structure, emoji usage, and contributor rules must always match the current state of the main documentation (e.g., readme.md).
- Only topics/categories with at least one resource are allowed; no empty sections.
- Each section must have an appropriate emoji, and the emoji legend must be updated as needed.
- Each resource appears only once, in the most relevant section.
- The Table of Contents must always be in sync with the section structure.
- All documentation uses GitHub-flavored Markdown.
- Contributor guidance and rules are documented in the memory bank and main documentation.
